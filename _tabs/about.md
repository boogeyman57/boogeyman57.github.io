My Cybersecurity Journey

Growing up, I was the curious kid who took apart everything just to see how it worked. A funny story I still laugh about is the time I disassembled our family DVD player but couldn’t figure out how to put it back together. That curiosity followed me into my teenage years when, in 6th grade, my father bought a PC for our home. Naturally, I couldn’t resist tinkering with it. I ended up installing a dual-boot system with Kali Linux and Windows, even though I had no idea what to do with Kali Linux back then—especially since we didn’t have an internet connection at the time.

Over time, that spark faded, but it wasn’t gone. During my bachelor's program, the 3G revolution hit India, and suddenly the internet became more affordable than bottled water. That accessibility reignited my passion for technology and cybersecurity. I began learning more about this fascinating field, diving into concepts, tools, and techniques with renewed excitement.

After completing my undergraduate studies, I decided to take my passion to the next level. I moved to the United States to pursue a master’s degree in cybersecurity. It was a transformative experience that allowed me to explore advanced concepts, work on exciting projects, and deepen my understanding of the field.

The Present
Today, I’m working as a Cybersecurity Engineer at a large insurance company. In my role, I focus on protecting critical systems, ensuring compliance, and mitigating risks to safeguard sensitive data. Each day offers fresh challenges, and I find great satisfaction in solving complex puzzles that enhance the organization’s security posture.

The Future
Looking ahead, I’m excited to further specialize as a Purple Teamer, bridging the gap between offensive and defensive cybersecurity. I’m also deeply interested in threat hunting—actively seeking out vulnerabilities and hidden threats before they can cause damage. My ultimate goal is to stay on the cutting edge of cybersecurity, contributing to an organization’s resilience while continuously sharpening my skills. Beyond technical work, I hope to inspire and mentor others entering this dynamic field, helping them navigate their own cybersecurity journeys.
